# My Portfolio Projects

This repository contains the projects that I've worked on during my time at the University of Toronto. Each project showcases different skills and knowledge in Python, C, algorithm design, data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning.

## Projects

### Fitness Tracker App Logic

This project involved developing the logic for a fitness tracker app. The app accurately tracks fitness metrics by managing many global variables.

### Gomoku (Five in a Row Game) Board Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes Gomoku boards. It uses nested lists to represent board states and facilitate efficient analysis.

### TOEFL Question Answering Model

This is a learning model capable of answering TOEFL questions with about 70% accuracy based on just 2 text libraries.

### Autocomplete Engine

This project is a high-performance autocomplete algorithm capable of processing large datasets and efficiently suggesting completions based on user input. It uses binary search instead of linear search to improve processing times by 50%.

### Automatic Voice-Controlled Waste Dispenser

This project was developed during a 24-hour hackathon. It's an automatic waste dispenser controlled by voice commands. The project integrates machine learning algorithms (Na√Øve Bayes) that achieved 85% accuracy in waste categorization. It also manages the communication between a Raspberry Pi running Linux and an Arduino Mega board to execute commands for opening corresponding waste bins.
